##Momentum##

Recall is just the Mass x Velocity

Momentum is conserved

Elastic collision: energy is never lost during a collision

##Pushing a block##

When we are pushing a block we are losing energy to friction which is why is it not saying in motion

The reason why it is not falling to gravity due to the force from the table (normal force?)

##Friction##

Best described as Friction resists the motion

F push - F friction = ma (the block accelerates)

If you apply a force that equals the friction and velocity then it moves at a constant speed

Two kinds

1. Static Friction (not moving keeps object in place [desk on floor])
2. Kinetic Friction (while moving)


When you are breaking in a car, when you are skidding that in kinetic friction force, when you are normally breaking as the tire still spins and causes friction that is static friction force


Generally static friction is bigger than kinetic friction 
hard to get the motion started

Friction does work HEAT

##Circular Motion##

When you are moving in a circle you are accelerating because your direction is changing

F=mv^2/R
Bigger radius, smaller force needed

Bigger velocity, larger force 

Inertia: - Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion; this includes changes to its speed, direction or state of rest. It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity.

Momentum

Torque:

Moment of Inertia: A quantity expressing a body's tendency to resist angular acceleration. It is the sum of the products of the mass of each particle in the body with the square of its distance from the axis of rotation.

Angular Momentum: You can change your angular velocity depending on your radius 

Conversation of Momentum:

* Linear Momentum
* Angular Momentum

## Water in a bucket ##

If gravitational force greater than that required for circular motion, the water will fall out of the bucket

If the gravitational force is smaller than that required for circular motion, the bucket will exert more force on the water to keep it moving in a circle

Circular Motion: 
As long as the force needed to go around in a circle is greater then the force needed for gravity then the water will stay in the bucket

##How the table cloth worked##

Small time for table cloth to leave
Small friction between cloth and dishes
Therefore small momentum with cloth and dishes

Small kinetic friction which gets very little acceleration 
F friction = ma
