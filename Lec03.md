##Travelling Waves##

Imagine a pulse on a string

Can have a wave traveling down the string or can have a standing wave

##Transverse Oscillations##

Strings movies up and down forming a wave that travels along the  string, simliar to the wave of the ocean

Amplitude (A): is the half of the maximum distance the wave goes up and down

Wavelength (lamda): the distance of one full repeat distance

Velocity (V): 

##Longitudinal Oscillation ##

Pressure is a force exerted over an area
Pressure = Force divided by Area

Strong force on a large area has same pressure as weak force on a small area

Sound is an example of this type of wave

Regions of low pressure and high pressure

##Speed of Wave##

Speed (V)
Frequency (f) The number of oscillations that occur in a second

Period (T) The time it takes for one oscillation to occur

Speed of traveling wave = Frequency X Wavelength
V = L x f

##Doppler Effect##

Speed of sound constant
Waves get compressed or expanded

When a train is moving to right, towards you wavelength smaller, frequency higher

Train moving to left, away from you wavelength larger frequency lower

##Harmonic Motion##
Pendulum - Simple harmonic motion

How an old fashion grandfather clock works, pendulum spinning a gear once a second 

##Resonance##

Oscillators have a natural frequency at which they prefer to oscillate

If energy is applied to the oscillator at the same frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation will increase

Example in class is the weight on the spring,  if you lift the spring when the weight is going up you gain amplitude

Another example is a swing, when they are leaving you add kinetic energy when they have all potential and no kinetic which will result in additional total energy 

Recall the bridge that collapsed due to oscillation as it got a little more energy from the wind ever oscillation 

##Standing Wave##

Harmonic frequency and other one (tldr)
Nodes
Antinodes

Higher the frequency the more nodes/antinode
