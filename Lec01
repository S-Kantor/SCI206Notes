##Inertia##

A body in motion tends to remain in motion
A body at rest tends to remain at rest

This is incorrect for most of the time because we don't consider all the existential forces that affect it

Position: Where you are

Velocity: 2 Parts, 1. How fast you are going (speed), which way you are going (direction)

Acceleration : How fast your velocity is changing speeding up. slowing down, changing direction

##Newton's Laws##

First Law: Force in motion stays in motion
Second Law: F=ma, force exerted on an object is equal to the product of the objects mas times its acceleration,

Easier to move a light object than a heavy one

Third Law: For every action, there is an reaction in the opposite direction.

For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on the first object

Good example is punching ballon

##Gravity##

F = mg gravity 

Normal force from ground pushes up on figure
FTotal = N - F = 0

Two High tides aday, we get that because the moon is closest to the earth at two times a day....(todo)

Why did the double cone roll upwards: Center of mass changes due to the V shape, although starting from the lower wooden plank, its center of mass is decreasing as it goes up higher to the wooden plank,

Expected reaction when we use cylinder instead of double cone (rolling from down to up)

##Falling Ball##

F=mg = ma
g=a 

acceleration is independent of mass thus a feather falls as fast as brick (in an airless chamber)
